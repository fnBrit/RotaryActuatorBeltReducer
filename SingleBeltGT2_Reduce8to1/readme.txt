Simple 8 to 1 reduction using a GT2 timing belt. Intrinsically close to zero backlash.
Requires that you print 1 each of the 128T GT2 pulley and the motor+motor mounting plate and bearing mount, I printed mine using Ultimaker Tough PLA.

Additional parts:
  1x NEMA 17 motor
  1x 320-GT2 2mm timing belt
  2x Bearing 42mm OD, 30mm ID, 7mm thick
  1x 9.5mm OD, 3mm ID idler pulley
  1x GT2 16 Tooth timing pulley, 5mm ID
  Miscellanious M3 bolts for mounting motor and idler pulley
